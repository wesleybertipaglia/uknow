## Core Features:

- Authentication Simulation: Simulate user authentication (sign-up, login) using localStorage. Data persists across sessions, providing a basic sense of user identity and continuity. A 'tool' within the feature verifies that entered user names and emails have appropriate formats for login.
- Profile Page: Display a user profile page with details such as profile photo, name, and bio. Include a list of the user's posts, friends, and joined communities. Implement an 'Add Friend' button that simulates adding friends, updating localStorage in real-time.
- Interactive Post Feed: Simulate the ability to like, comment on, and share posts. Update the post interactions in real-time via localStorage.
- Community Interaction Simulation: Implement a 'Join/Leave Community' button that updates a user's community memberships, stored in localStorage, reflecting real-time changes.
- Post Creation: Enable users to create new posts that are added to their profile and the main feed, with the new posts and user information instantly stored and reflected via localStorage.
- Friend Management: Add the ability for a user to unfriend existing friends from their friends list and update localStorage. Persisting this data provides the feeling of permanence, as expected in a social media app.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft sky blue (#A0D2EB), reminiscent of early web designs. This gentle hue brings a calming effect, aligning with the understated style of the 2000s.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0) provides a neutral backdrop that enhances the soft blues and reduces visual strain, mirroring the simple layouts of early social platforms.
- Accent color: Pale lavender (#D0BFFF) introduces a subtle contrast, highlighting interactive elements without overwhelming the nostalgic aesthetic, in harmony with vintage tech interfaces.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a blend of modern readability and nostalgic web feel. Its humanist qualities add warmth, fitting the personal interaction focus of social networking.
- Employ box-like layouts with subtle shadows to mimic the interface design of early 2000s websites. Maintain simplicity and structure, allowing for easy navigation and a clear display of content.
- Use simple, recognizable icons with a slightly pixelated or shadowed style to further evoke the 2000s aesthetic. Prioritize clarity and ease of understanding over overly modern designs.
- Implement minimal, functional animations (e.g., fading transitions) that load quickly. Focus on enhancing user interaction without flashy, distracting effects, keeping a fast, efficient, retro vibe.
